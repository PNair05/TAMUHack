# 🚗 toyotAI - Your AI-Powered Car Buying Companion

## 🏆 Built at TamuHack for the Toyota Challenge

toyotAI was built in 24 hours at **TamuHack** for the **Toyota Challenge**, where we set out to redefine the car-buying experience. Our team collaborated intensively to create an innovative and intuitive way for customers to find their ideal vehicle with AI-driven recommendations, an engaging personality quiz, and an intelligent virtual salesman.

## 🎯 What Does toyotAI Do?

toyotAI is an **AI-powered car recommendation platform** designed to make car shopping seamless and fun! Instead of endless filtering and manual searches, users can:

🚀 **Take a Fun Personality Quiz** – Discover the best Toyota model that matches your lifestyle.

💬 **Chat with a Virtual Salesman** – Get AI-driven insights on the best car options tailored to you.

🔍 **Use Traditional Filtering** – For those who prefer a classic approach, refine your search with familiar filters like price, MPG, and features.

## 💡 What We Learned

This project was an incredible opportunity to deepen our technical and teamwork skills. Some of the major takeaways include:

📊 **Backend with Pandas** – We used the Pandas library to process and analyze car data efficiently, making our recommendation system smarter.

🎨 **Enhanced UI/UX in React** – We refined our frontend skills, creating an engaging and responsive experience with **React** and **CSS**.

🤝 **Collaboration & Teamwork** – Working under time constraints pushed us to efficiently divide tasks, communicate effectively, and integrate our work seamlessly.

🧠 **Implementing AI Features** – Our virtual salesman leverages **OpenAI's GPT API** for intelligent conversations, and for our recommendation system/vehicle matching quiz.
